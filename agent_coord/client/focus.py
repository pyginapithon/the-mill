"""Desk focus: the label whose name is the desk id ranks that desk's cards (#374).

Anyone ranks a card for a desk with `mill label todo <id> <desk> --ord N`
(0 pinned, 65535 unplaced). Two readers, both on existing read paths.

Focus skips cards that are done, parked, or held by another desk. Rank is
ord ascending (0 pinned first), ties by card id. Client only: the wall
serves the same reads it did in 0.7.8, so an older client sees nothing new.

- `todo --mine` lists the focus cards on the board first, in label rank
  order (one `trail --label <desk>` read, only when a board card wears it),
  then the desk's claimed cards.
- `mill connect`, once seated, prints one `{"kind": "focus"}` line with the
  top FOCUS_TOP focus cards from the same board `todo --mine` reads (the
  desk's rosters), so the desk knows what to work on next without asking;
  nothing when there are none, and one stderr line naming the cause when a
  read fails (#536).
